ABOUT                                                            *argwrap-about*

argwrap.vim is an industrial strength argument wrapping and unwrapping extension
for the Vim text editor. It can be used for collapsing and expanding everything
from function calls to array and dictionary definitions. The online resources
listed below can be accessed to download new versions of this extension and to
access other information.

================================================================================
INSTALLATION                                              *argwrap-installation*

1.  Clone or otherwise download the latest version of the argwrap.vim extension
    from its GitHub page (the script is also available for download through
    vim.org.  If you are using pathogen.vim for plugin management (you should)
    you can clone the repository directly to your bundle directory:

    git clone https://github.com/FooSoft/vim-argwrap ~/.vim/bundle/vim-argwrap

2.  Create a keyboard binding for argwrap#toggle() inside your ~/.vimrc file.
    For example, to declare a normal mode mapping, add the following command:

    nnoremap <silent> <leader>w :call argwrap#toggle()<CR>

3.  You can customize the wrapping/unwrapping behavior of this extension by
    setting values for any of the following optional global variables in your
    .vimrc file:

    *   g:argwrap_wrap_style

        Specifies the style in which arguments should be wrapped.

        'default' argument wrapping:

        Foo(
            wibble,
            wobble,
            wubble
        )

        'bx' argument wrapping:

        Foo(wibble
            , wobble
            , wubble
            )

    *   g:argwrap_padded_braces

        Specifies which brace types should be padded on the inside with spaces:

        '': do not add padding for any braces (empty string):

        [1, 2, 3]
        {1, 2, 3}

        '[': padding for square braces only (curly braces are not padded):

        [ 1, 2, 3 ]
        {1, 2, 3}

        Padding can be specified for multiple brace types as follows:

        let g:argwrap_padded_braces = '[{'

USAGE                                                            *argwrap-usage*

1.  Position the cursor inside of the scope of the parenthesis, brackets or
    curly braces you wish to wrap/unwrap (not on top, before or after them).

2.  Execute the keyboard binding you defined above to toggle the wrapping and
    unwrapping of arguments.

EXAMPLES                                                      *argwrap-examples*

Below are some examples of common use cases demonstrating the capabilities of
argwrap.vim. Note that the extension functions identically regardless if it is
being applied to a function call, list or dictionary definition.

Let's begin with a simple function invocation. When there are many arguments
being passed to the function, we often wish to wrap them to improve code
readability. If you position your cursor anywhere between the parenthesis and
execute the argwrap#toggle() command, the argument list will be wrapped to one
per line.

Foo(wibble, wobble, wubble)

Becomes this:

Foo(
    wibble,
    wobble,
    wubble
)

List definitions work in a similar fashion:

foo = [bar, baz, qux, quux, corge]

Becomes this:

foo = [
    bar,
    baz,
    qux,
    quux,
    corge
]

Dictionaries also work the way you expected them to:

foo = {bar: 1, baz: 3, qux: 3, quux: 7}

Becomes this:

foo = {
    bar: 1,
    baz: 3,
    qux: 3,
    quux: 7
}

Finally, nested combinations of all the above are also supported:

Foo([wibble, wobble, wubble], spam, {bar: baz, qux: [1, 3, 3, 7]})

Becomes this:

Foo(
    [wibble, wobble, wubble],
    spam,
    {bar: baz, qux: [1, 3, 3, 7]}
)

You can continue argument expansion to:

Foo(
    [
        wibble,
        wobble,
        wubble
    ],
    spam,
    {
        bar: baz,
        qux: [
            1,
            3,
            3,
            7
        ]
    }
)

The argument wrapping and unwrapping operations demonstrated above are easily
reversible and correctly preserve the indentation of the surrounding code. This
extension has been tested to work in scenarios of various complexity, but if you
discover a problem don't hesitate to report it.
